## Usage

Use `use-headroom` hook to create headers that are hidden after user scrolls past given distance in px. The hook returns a boolean value that determines whether element should be pinned or hidden. Hook returns `true` when current scroll position is less than specified `fixedAt` value and after user scrolled up.
