## Usage

`use-isomorphic-effect` allows you to switch between `useEffect` during server side rendering and `useLayoutEffect` after hydration. Use it wherever you would use `useLayoutEffect` to avoid warnings during ssr:

```tsx
import { useIsomorphicEffect } from "@bigcomponents/hooks";

function Demo() {
  useIsomorphicEffect(() => {
    document.title = "title";
  });

  return null;
}
```
