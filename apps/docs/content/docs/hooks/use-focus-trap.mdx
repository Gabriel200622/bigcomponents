title: use-focus-trap
component: false
description: Trap focus inside given node
---

## Usage

use-focus-trap traps focus at given node, for example in modal, drawer or menu. Node must include at least one focusable element. When node unmounts, focus trap is automatically disabled.

```tsx
import { useFocusTrap } from "@bigcomponents/hooks";

function Demo() {
  const focusTrapRef = useFocusTrap();

  return (
    <div ref={focusTrapRef}>
      <input />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API

Hook accepts focus trap active state as single argument:

```tsx
useFocusTrap(); // -> focus trap inactive
useFocusTrap(true); // -> focus trap active

useFocusTrap(false); // -> focus trap disabled
```

Hook returns `ref` that should be passed to dom node:

```tsx
const focusTrapRef = useFocusTrap();

// With regular element:
<div ref={focusTrapRef} />;
```

## Combine with other ref based hooks

Usually focus trap is not used alone. To combine use-focus-trap hook with other ref based hooks use [use-merged-ref](/docs/hooks/use-merged-ref) hook:

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import {
  useClickOutside,
  useFocusTrap,
  useMergedRef,
} from "@bigcomponents/hooks";

function Demo() {
  const myRef = useRef();
  const useClickOutsideRef = useClickOutside(() => {});
  const focusTrapRef = useFocusTrap();
  const mergedRef = useMergedRef(myRef, useClickOutsideRef, focusTrapRef);

  return <div ref={mergedRef} />;
}
```

## Initial focus

By default, focus trap will move focus to first interactive element. To specify element that should receive initial focus add `data-autofocus` attribute, note that focus trap works with dom and this attribute should be added to element:

```tsx
import { useFocusTrap } from "@bigcomponents/hooks";

function Demo() {
  const focusTrapRef = useFocusTrap();

  return (
    <div ref={focusTrapRef}>
      <input />
      {/* Second input in modal will have initial focus */}
      <input data-autofocus />
      <input />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Definition

```tsx
function useFocusTrap(active?: boolean): (instance: HTMLElement) => void;
```
