## Usage

<ComponentPreview name="use-element-size-demo" />

## API

use-element-size is a simpler version of [use-resize-observer](/docs/hooks/use-resize-observer) hook. Hook returns `ref` object that should be passed to the observed element, and the element's `height` and `width`. On the first render (as well as during SSR), or when no element is being observed, `width` and `height` properties are equal to `0`.

```tsx
const { ref, width, height } = useElementSize();
```

## Definition

```tsx
function useElementSize<T extends HTMLElement = any>(): {
  MutableRefObject<T>,
  width: number,
  height: number
};
```
