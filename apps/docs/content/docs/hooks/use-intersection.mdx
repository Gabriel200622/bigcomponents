## Usage

`use-intersection` gets information about the intersection of a given element with its scroll container or body element with [Intersection Observer API:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)

<ComponentPreview name="use-intersection-demo" />

## API

Hook accepts `IntersectionObserver`'s options as its only optional argument:

```tsx
useIntersection({
  root: someDomElement,
  rootMargin: "0rem",
  threshold: 1.0,
});
```

Hook returns `ref` function that should be passed to the observed element, and the latest entry, as returned by `IntersectionObserver`'s callback. See [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) documentation to learn everything about options.

On the first render (as well as during SSR), or when no element is being observed, the entry is `null`.

```tsx
const { ref, entry } = useIntersection();

<div ref={ref}>Observed</div>;
```

## Definition

```tsx
function useIntersection<T extends HTMLElement = any>(
  options?: ConstructorParameters<typeof IntersectionObserver>[1]
): {
  ref: (element: T | null) => void;
  entry: IntersectionObserverEntry;
};
```
